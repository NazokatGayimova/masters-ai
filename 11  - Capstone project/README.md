# üåç AI-Driven Air Quality Inquiry Agent

## üöÄ Overview
This project features an **AI-driven agent for air quality inquiries** that provides users with the ability to:
1. **Access historical air quality data** using an SQL-based database.
2. **Forecast future air quality trends** for specific locations.
3. **Direct users to OpenWeather when data is not available** in the database.

It incorporates:
- **OpenAI GPT** to create SQL queries on-the-fly.
- **SQLite** as a local database for air quality data storage.
- **Streamlit** for an engaging and easy-to-use web interface.
- **Scikit-learn** for modeling and predicting air quality trends.

Challenges/difficulties faced: 
- OpenWeather APi key did not work and when recreated it took hours to be active but deactivated quickly which led to not interacting with OpenWeather website directly and providing the data from the website to the user.
